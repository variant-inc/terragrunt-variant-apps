In this guide, you will learn

1. Create new S3 buckets
2. Use Existing S3 buckets
   1. Find By Name
   2. Find By Project

*If no bucket is needed, do not add `buckets` under `infrastructure`*

## Examples

### Create Bucket

Consider that the infrastructure created below is for

- project_name: hello-world
- project_group: demo

```bash
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    managed:
      - prefix: hello-world
        reference: hw
```

The application will be deployed with the following `environnement variables`

```bash
BUCKET__hw__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
BUCKET__hw__name = "hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
```

### Add Existing Bucket Using Prefix & Project

To use the bucket created in the above example in another project.

```bash
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    existing:
      - project_name: hello-world
        project_group: demo
        bucket_prefix: hello-world
        reference: hello
```

The application will be deployed with the following `environnement variables`

```bash
BUCKET__hello__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
BUCKET__hello__name = "hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
```

### Add Existing Bucket Using Name

```bash
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    existing:
      - full_name: hello-world20220112134106599600000001
        reference: mine
```

`full_name` is the full name of the bucket as provided in AWS console.

The application will be deployed with the following `environnement variables`

```bash
BUCKET__mine__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
BUCKET__mine__name = "hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
```

### Mix and Match

```bash
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    managed:
      - prefix: hello-world
        reference: hw
    existing:
      - project_name: hello-world
        project_group: demo
        bucket_prefix: jupiter
        reference: hello
      - full_name: usx-store-data
        reference: usx
```

The application will be deployed with the following `environnement variables`

```bash
BUCKET__hello__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::hello-world20220112134106599600000001"
BUCKET__hello__name = "hello-world20220112134106599600000001"

BUCKET__jupiter__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::jupiter-api-project-20220112134106599600000001"
BUCKET__jupiter__name = "jupiter-api-project-20220112134106599600000001"

BUCKET__usx__arn = "arn:aws:s3:::usx-store-data"
BUCKET__usx__name = "usx-store-data"
```

## Supported Attributes

The following attributes should be added under

```bash
infrastructure:
  buckets:
```

[Inputs](../modules/common/buckets/README.md#inputs)

## Exposed Environment Variables

Below are the exposed env variables and can be referenced  in the code with below names.

| Env variable               | Description             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| BUCKET__\<reference>__name | Full Name of the Bucket |
| BUCKET__\<reference>__arn  | Bucket ARN              |
