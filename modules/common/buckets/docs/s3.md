S3 Buckets to optionally create and reference in your deployment. This need to be added under infrastructure section with buckets and support attributes. If no bucket is needed, just donâ€™t have to add buckets section with the infrastructure.

## Buckets
Here is the sample format to add buckets to the application.

```yaml
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    managed:
      - prefix: <BUCKET_NAME>
    existing:
      - project_name: <RELEASE_NAME_IN_NAMESPACE>
        project_group: <NAMESPACE>
        bucket_prefix: <BUCKET_NAME>
```

Example

```yaml
infrastructure:
  buckets:
    existing:
      - project_name: demo-python-flask-variant-api
        project_group: demo
        bucket_prefix: demo-flask-api
```


### Supported attributes

| Property | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                      |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| managed  | string | false    | N/A     | This need to be added to create new bucket. Add as an array to create multiple buckets.          |
| managed  | string | false    | N/A     | This need to be added to refer any existing  buckets. Add as an array to refer multiple buckets. |

### managed

Adding prefix under this section will create a new bucket in the AWS and will provide required permissions to the app to access the bucket. If multiple buckets need to be created then it can be added as array to the managed object.

Adding bucket with below format will create an env variable and can be referenced as BUCKET__<PREFIX>__name in the code and the bucket name will be something like demo-flask-api20220308185624693400000001.

| Property | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                    |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| prefix   | string | true     | N/A     | Name of the bucket (Example:  demo-flask-api ) |

### existing

Adding project_name and project_group to configuration will be used to lookup in the AWS with the correct namespace and bucket_prefix will be the bucket name to refer in the application. If multiple buckets are needed to the app, then it can be added as an array to the existing object.

Adding bucket with below format will create an env variable and can be referenced as BUCKET__<BUCKET_PREFIX>__name in the code and the bucket name need to be actual bucket name from the AWS s3.

| Property      | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                        |
|---------------|--------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bucket_prefix | string | true     | N/A     | Bucket to refer from the app (Example:  demo-flask-api20220308185624693400000001 ) |
| project_name  | string | true     | N/A     | Release name in namespace (Example:  demo-python-flask-variant-api )               |
| project_group | string | true     | N/A     | amespace (Example: demo)                                                           |

### Exposed environment variables

Below are the exposed env variables and can be referenced  in the code with below names.

| Env variable                  | Description          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| BUCKET__<BUCKET_PREFIX>__name | To refer bucket name |
| BUCKET__<BUCKET_PREFIX>__arn  | Bucket arn           |
